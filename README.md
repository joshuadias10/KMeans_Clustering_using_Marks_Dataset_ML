# K-Means Clustering on Student Marks Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that implements K-Means clustering on a student marks dataset. The analysis segments students based on their marks in English and Maths. The script uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualizes the clustering results to provide insights into student performance patterns.

## Files

- `KMeans_Clustering_using_Marks_Dataset.ipynb`: Python script for clustering students' marks, including the Elbow Method implementation and result visualizations.

## Installation

To run the script, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
